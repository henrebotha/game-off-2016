This is my entry to the Github Game Off 2016! My chosen theme is "modding", in the sense of moderating social media. Watch this space...

## Dev log

Still on honeymoon, I started to think about the theme and brainstorm concepts and mechanics. I also started doing research into frameworks, settling on Phaser after I saw how simple it was to use.

Back home! By this point I'd decided to do a game on "modding", in the sense of moderating social media. What I'm going to shoot for is DDR meets Papers, Please, where you play a faceless moderator drone in some outsourced location in Asia. Your job is to review posts flagged by an "obscenity heuristic" and block them if you deem them to be obscene as per company policy.

I forked the repo and did some initial setup work. I used [this handy guide](http://perplexingtech.weebly.com/game-dev-blog/using-states-in-phaserjs-javascript-game-developement) as a reference to set up the various states in my game. Phaser states strike me as a code organisation tool; even if I don't have hectic resource management or similar requirements, states allow me to just split up the different logical phases of the game into different logical units that can summon each other in a sensible way.

I also set up my itch.io, in case people want to donate a dollar or two to keep me motivated. ðŸ˜‰
